# Machine Learning: Biased Datasets

This module addresses one of the most critical challenges in machine learning: dataset bias and its impact on model performance, fairness, and real-world applications. Learn to identify, measure, and mitigate bias in training datasets.

## üìö Contents

### Training Dataset Size Bias Solution
**File**: `Training_Dataset_Size_Bias_Solution.ipynb`

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand different types of dataset bias
- Identify training dataset size bias and its implications
- Implement bias detection and measurement techniques
- Apply bias mitigation strategies
- Evaluate model fairness across different groups

## üéØ Key Topics Covered

### Types of Dataset Bias:
- **Selection Bias**: Systematic differences between sample and population
- **Measurement Bias**: Errors in data collection or labeling
- **Size Bias**: Unequal representation of different groups
- **Temporal Bias**: Changes in data distribution over time
- **Geographic Bias**: Regional or location-based differences
- **Demographic Bias**: Underrepresentation of certain demographic groups

### Bias Detection Methods:
- **Statistical Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across groups
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal true positive and false positive rates
- **Demographic Parity**: Equal selection rates across groups
- **Calibration**: Equal prediction confidence across groups
- **Intersectional Analysis**: Bias across multiple protected attributes

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Pre-processing**: Data augmentation, rebalancing, synthetic data generation
- **In-processing**: Fairness constraints, adversarial training, regularization
- **Post-processing**: Threshold adjustment, calibration, output modification
- **Algorithmic Approaches**: Fair representation learning, bias-aware models

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Required Packages:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

## üìä Bias Analysis Framework

### 1. Bias Detection
```python
# Example: Demographic parity analysis
def demographic_parity_analysis(y_true, y_pred, protected_attribute):
    """
    Analyze demographic parity across protected groups
    """
    results = {}
    for group in np.unique(protected_attribute):
        mask = protected_attribute == group
        group_positive_rate = y_pred[mask].mean()
        results[group] = group_positive_rate
    
    return results
```

### 2. Bias Measurement
- **Disparate Impact**: Ratio of positive prediction rates
- **Equal Opportunity Difference**: Difference in true positive rates
- **Average Odds Difference**: Average of true positive and false positive rate differences
- **Calibration Difference**: Difference in prediction confidence

### 3. Mitigation Implementation
```python
# Example: Rebalancing approach
def rebalance_dataset(X, y, protected_attribute, target_ratio=0.5):
    """
    Rebalance dataset to achieve target ratio across groups
    """
    # Implementation of rebalancing logic
    pass
```
