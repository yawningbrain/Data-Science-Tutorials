# Neuron Models Collection

This folder contains comprehensive tutorials on computational neuroscience models, from the classical Hodgkin-Huxley model to simplified neuron models and neural networks.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Hodgkin-Huxley Model (`hodgkin_huxley_model.ipynb`)
- **Purpose**: Implementation of the classic Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model
- **Features**: 
  - Detailed mathematical formulation
  - Interactive parameter exploration
  - Advanced visualizations of membrane dynamics
  - Comparison with experimental data
- **Learning Objectives**: Understand the biophysical basis of action potential generation

### 2. Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model (`leaky_integrate_fire.ipynb`)
- **Purpose**: Simplified neuron model for network simulations
- **Features**:
  - STDP (Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity) implementation
  - Network connectivity and dynamics
  - Performance analysis and optimization
- **Learning Objectives**: Learn about simplified neuron models and synaptic plasticity

### 3. Perceptron Model (`perceptron_neural_network.ipynb`)
- **Purpose**: Introduction to artificial neural networks
- **Features**:
  - Binary classification with perceptron

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- Basic understanding of differential equations
- Familiarity with neuroscience concepts (helpful but not required)

## Usage

Each notebook is self-contained and can be run independently. Start with the Hodgkin-Huxley model for a comprehensive understanding of neuron biophysics, then proceed to simplified models.
